# challenge

This repository has the solutions of the tasks 3. and 4. for a given challenge.
The tasks are:

1. Setup and run an instance of NetBox DCIM/IPAM (and all required components)
   as containers. Reference: see http://www.netbox.dev
2. Populate the NetBox DCIM/IPAM with dummy data (hint: use netbox-demo-data)
3. Write a python script to add a journal entry to a device of your choice (by using
   the NetBox API).
4. Create a minimalistic docker container which takes your script from #3 and adds
   a journal entry to a NetBox device every 5 minutes.
